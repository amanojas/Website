\maketitle

As a part of the course, you are responsible for writing a book review
of a book of your choice from a list given below. Every individual
should only write a book review on \textbf{one} topic of her choice. You
will be responsible for submitting your work on the blackboard using the
file name in following way : \textbf{FIRSTNAME\_LASTNAME.pdf}.
\textbf{You will be tested on plagiarism, so prepare the book review in
your own words instead of directly copying from the internet.} Here are
the recommended questions that you should answer in your book review.
Find the following information on writing a book review. I hope this is
helpful for you to have a structure in your head while writing your book
review.

\textbf{Establish a Background, Remember your Audience:} Remember that
your audience is a typical normal person; with this in mind, be sure to
introduce characters and principles carefully and deliberately. What
kind of summary can you provide of the main points or main characters
that will help your readers gauge their interest? Does the author's text
adequately reach the intended audience? Will some readers be lost or
find the text too easy?

\textbf{Minor principles/characters:} Deal only with the most pressing
issues in the book. You will not be able to cover every character or
idea. What principles/characters did you agree or disagree with? What
other things might the author have researched or considered?

\textbf{Organize:} The purpose of the review is to critically evaluate
the text, not just inform the readers about it. Leave plenty room for
your evaluation by ensuring that your summary is brief. Determine what
kind of balance to strike between your summary information and your
evaluation. If you are writing your review for a class, ask your
instructor. Often the ratio is half and half.

\textbf{Your Evaluation:} Choose one or a few points to discuss about
the book. What worked well for you? How does this work compare with
others by the same author or other books in the same genre? What major
themes, motifs, or terms does the book introduce, and how effective are
they? Did the book appeal to you on an emotional or logical way?
