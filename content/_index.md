description: I am a doctoral student in the Department of Economics at the Graduate Center, CUNY. My    research interests are  at the intersection of income inequality, intergenerational income mobility,    and their public policy implications. I am    also interested in financial modeling using advanced statistical and machine learning techniques. In my spare time, I like to read non-fiction, watch cricket, and soccer games.
