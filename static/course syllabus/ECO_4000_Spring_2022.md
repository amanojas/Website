## Instructor Information 
**Name** : Aman Ojas Desai\
**Email** : adesai@gradcenter.cuny.edu\
**Class Schedule** : MoWe 9:05 AM-10:20AM (In-Person)\
**Room** = B - Vert 5-160\
**Office Hours**: MoWe 10:30 AM - 11:30 AM\


## Course Description

The course introduces econometric techniques useful to conduct empirical analysis in economics and finance. The purpose of the course is to enable the student to master the concepts and be able to complete an independent empirical project. 

## Enrollment Requirements

STA 2000 or equivalent and ZICK or ZKTP Student Group and ECO-BA Plan or STA-BA Plan or FIN-BBA Plan or ECO-BBA Plan or ECO-MIN or ZKECOF-MIN Plan and with 45 credits.

## Learning Outcomes

Firms, governmental or non-governmental agencies, regulators, experts, etc., all rely increasingly on data analysis to assess situations and take decisions. Statistical analysis and econometrics offer powerful tools that are easy to use but that need to be used properly. Interpreting correctly results from a statistical analysis is also paramount to the discipline.\

By the end of the semester students will be able to:  

- Handle data in a professional manner\
- Know how to use different statistical programs and know which one is the most appropriate for the type of study.\ 
-	Recognize the main pitfalls encountered in statistical analysis.\ 
-	Develop knowledge of the basic principles of probability and statistics\
-	Develop understanding of the Linear Regression Model (LRM) and its use in modeling the relationship between economic and financial variables\
-	Be able to estimate and test hypothesis about the parameters of the LRM \
-	Be able to conduct an empirical investigation using econometric techniques \
-	Be able to present the results of a statistical analysis. \

## Course Materials
Course material will be posted on the blackboard and will consist of lecture notes, problem sets, and datasets. The course will be self-sufficient. You will not have to buy a textbook. Econometrics is a major component of research in economics and finance. There are many textbooks and supplementary material to be found on the internet including video tutorials, practice problems, and handouts. Students having doubts about the adequacy of a specific source should discuss with the instructor. Students who wish to acquire a textbook should preferably consider one of the following textbooks.\

## Grading Policy
Assignments, midterm, and final exams will all be graded over 100 (0 is the worst grade, 100 the best). Sometimes the number of points of each question (in an assignment, the midterm, or the final) is displayed. If the total is higher than 100 the grade will be the percentage of the total number of points. 

### Course Evaluation Scheme
**Assignments**	-	40%\
**Midterm** 		-	30%\

## Required Software

The assignments throughout the semester will involve some problems that require coding. The primary software for the class will be R as it is open source and available for free to all. 

Install R - https://cran.r-project.org/ 

Install R studio - https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

More information on this will be provided in class.

## Policy Regarding Make-up Exams and Deadline Extensions
Students are responsible for checking the exam dates and avoid any conflict with other commitments. There will be no make-ups for exams except only if: 

-	The student has contacted the instructor before the exam and the instructor has agreed to organize a make-up exam (interviews or business trips do not constitute a valid excuse to have a makeup).\
-	There is a case of documented serious illness, civic obligation, accident. \

## Attendance and Lateness Policies

Attendance will not be checked. It is the students’ responsibility to attend classes. Sometimes, some information that is relevant for the midterm and the final exam will be given during the class (information that will not be found on lecture notes, books, or other supports). 

## Counselling Service

At Baruch, we acknowledge that as a student, you are balancing many demands. During the semester, if you start to experience personal difficulties or stressors that are interfering with your academic performance or day to day functioning, please consider seeking free and confidential support at the Baruch College Counseling Center. For more information or to make an appointment, please visit their website at https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/counseling/ or call 646-312-2155. If it's outside of business hours (Monday-Friday 9-5pm) and you need immediate assistance, please call 1-888-NYC-WELL (888-692-9355). If you are concerned about one of your classmates, please share that concern by filling out a Campus Intervention Team form at  https://studentaffairs.baruch.cuny.edu/campus-intervention-team.

## Student Disabilities Service

We have a process at Baruch for determining whether a student who identifies as disabled is eligible for reasonable accommodations in order to complete the student’s academic program. We strive to ensure that no student with a disability is discriminated against and that none is denied participation in college programs and activities for lack of reasonable accommodations. 
Some people think that a disability has to be visible to be accommodated. This is not the case. There are many disabilities – diabetes, psychological illness, learning disabilities, AIDS, seizure disorders, arthritis, etc., – that require accommodations. 
Examples of accommodations include additional testing time; adaptive equipment; and taping of classes. If you feel that you may need a reasonable accommodation based on a disability, please contact the staff at the Office of Disability Services, Newman Vertical Campus, Room 2-271, or by phone at (646) 312-4590.

## Academic Integrity 

I fully support Baruch College's policy on Academic, which states, in part: 
"Academic dishonesty is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Cheating, forgery, plagiarism, and collusion in dishonest acts undermine the college's educational mission and the students' personal and intellectual growth. Baruch students are expected to bear individual responsibility for their work, to learn the rules and definitions that underlie the practice of academic integrity, and to uphold its ideals. Ignorance of the rules is not an acceptable excuse for disobeying them. Any student who attempts to compromise or devalue the academic process will be sanctioned." Additional information can be found at http://www.baruch.cuny.edu/academic/academic_honesty.html

Students caught cheating will first receive a PEN grade and a report of suspected academic dishonesty will be sent to the Office of the Dean of Students. That grade will then be changed to an F grade (on top of the penalty decided by the Office of the Dean of Students).
